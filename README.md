# DoMeLint

[![tests](https://github.com/nikolai-katkov/do-me-lint/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nikolai-katkov/do-me-lint/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

## What

CLI tool to make your JS/TS projects linted with ESLint and Prettier for the best possible developer experience.

## For whom

For busy developers who appreciate the benefits of code linting but find it tedious. For those who find themselves in the following situations:

<details>
<summary>See motivation</summary>
<p>

**I spend too much time to read ESLint rule docs.** It indicates that you are not happy with just applying recommended configs. To make a concious choice you have to learn what is considered a warning, how it might conflict with other rules, test all the rule options. **For hundreds of rules.**

**I don't remember why this rule is here.** Is your current config specific to the project? Do you keep track of the reasons to enable or disable a specific rule?

**I'm not sure if a rule is enabled in my config at all.** ESLint configurations work like layers: one recommended config can enable a rule, another one can cancel it, recommended configs are usually extended from some "base" in a tree-like hierarchy. In addition your project config may be impacted by the parent folder config unless you explicitly forbid it.

**I'd like to use modern ESLint plugins, but I have no time to monitor it.** You suspect that ESLint world is awesome, but trying out all these plugins?

**Sometimes I see more than one warning for the same code.** It indicates you have conflicting rules, or some cases are covered by Typescript.

## Features

- Configures ESLint, Prettier and your IDE (currently VSCode only)
- Scans your codebase: fixes all fixable ESLint rules and formats all files with Prettier
- Adds all Git-ignored patterns to `.prettierignore` and `.eslintignore`
- Provides you a detailed report of the most common errors
- Rules are managed in a Google spreadsheet
- Rules are finely selected for you from the [best plugins](#supported-eslint-plugins)
- Your projects gets only relevant rules, e.g. you get Typescript plugin and rules only if you have typescript as a dependency
- All ESlint configuration is stored in a single `.eslintrc.yml` file. DoMeLint ensures there are no conflicting configurations. No extended, recommended or nested configurations - what you see is what you get.
- No configuration needed
- Still fully flexible: you can specify your file patterns, disable rules that are not worth fixing (see [configuration](#configuration) section), and have completely own, team- or company-wide spreadsheet (see [forking](#forking-the-rules-spreadsheet) section)
- Supports new projects and existing codebases
- Automatically updates linting dependencies using your project's dependency manager, Yarn or NPM
- Supports monorepos - configures IDE once for the whole repo while keeping linting configurations per project

## Usage

```bash
cd [path-to-your-project]
npx do-me-lint
```

### Best practices

You can achieve best results running `do-me-lint` once or periodically if you want to keep the configuration up to date.

It makes sense to keep `.domelintrc.yml` as part of your git repository.

For monorepos you need to run the script from each project's directory.

## Troubleshooting

If there are too many warnings to fix in one go:

- revert the changes
- disable the rules you don't want to fix (see [configuration](#configuration) section, `ignoreRules`)
- apply the command again

If `do-me-lint` throws an error or stops responding at the _"Checking required NPM dependencies"_ step, run it again in the debug mode:

```bash
DML_DEBUG=1 npx do-me-lint
```

## Configuration

`do-me-lint` reads script settings in the following priority:

1. Environment variables
2. Settings in `.domelintrc.yml`
3. Default values

> All settings are optional

## Google Sheets as a source of truth

![Spreadsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikolai-katkov/do-me-lint/master/docs/spreadsheet.png)

### Motivation to use Google Sheets

- More illustrative than any configuration format
- Easy to export: no API keys
- Easy to update: auto-save, no need to commit
- Inherent Google Sheets features: change history, comments, custom styling, sorting, filtering

### Forking the rules spreadsheet

You want to create your own spreadsheet if

- You have your own (or team) guidelines that go against the default spreadsheet
- You need to make sure the rule selection doesn't change in the future
- You forked the repo to add custom logic and now want to add/modify meaning of the columns

You **don't** want to create your own spreadsheet if

- do-me-lint reported too many warnings that are not worth fixing. Use `ignoredRules` [setting](#configuration) instead.
- you see that some rule in the default spreadsheet doesn't make sense, or missing, or broken. Open an [issue](https://github.com/nikolai-katkov/do-me-lint/issues) instead.

#### Steps to fork the spreadsheet

1. Open a [source](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/149ecBpNj1mfgTKlCcVwxdKbi5VDNeJdsVW-c2Y62z9k/edit#gid=1499443148) spreadsheet
2. Clone it by selecting menu `File` -> `Make a copy`
3. Make any changes, add rules, enable/disable desired rules etc.
4. Export as CSV via `File` -> `Publish to the web`: <br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikolai-katkov/do-me-lint/master/docs/csv-publish.png" width="300"/>
5. Configure spreadsheet and CSV URLs as stated in [configuration](#configuration) section
